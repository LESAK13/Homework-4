# Homework-4

For this homework assignement, it was necessary to code JavaScript to produce a multiple choice quiz.  I made a simple five question quiz made up of NFL history questions.

First, I set up the initial HTML with my divs, ids and start button along with some basic CSS.

For the JavaScript, I started with the variables using the getElementbyId function to reference the elements.

Next, I set up the event listener for the start button to start the quiz.

I then designed an opject of questions with an array for each answer set and the index of the correct response.
